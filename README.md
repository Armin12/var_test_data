# Shiny App that predicts Iris species with variable test samples

This application predicts the species label of a flower given the petal and sepal length and width. The model is trained with Random Forests and all four features in the Iris dataset are being used. 150 data samples in this dataset are divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing.

You can choose any number of test samples (between 1 to 45) to use by changing the sidebar. The output plot shows which samples are predicted correctly (blue) and which are not (red). Using radio buttons, you can select to show different information on Y and X axes (features). The App also presents predicted values at the bottom. 

When you run the App, it takes few seconds for the plot to appear.
